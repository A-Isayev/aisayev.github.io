		<h1>Recent Books I've Read</h1>
		<p> With the end of covid I decided to spend some more time reading, I still havent had the opportunity to do so as often as I would like but heres a little list nonetheless. </P>
		<p> For some reason I found that although I enjoy reading I instead spend that rare time reading internet novels or unpublished works but avoid properly published books due to their size and the time commitment;
		<br>
As such I decided to expand my horizons, looking through avid readers recommendations for where I should start and what to read. This video is one I found myself referencing:</p>
<!-- The only reason im not using the video element here and instead refering to embed code that youtube gives you directly in the "share" feature is because this video is 30 minutes long and i tried to download it for half an hour and its just didn't go through, i gave up. I want people to have access to the original link and easily get to it so it might be for the best -->
